# Bank_Loans_Data_Analysis
## 1.Business Problem
Financial institutions face significant losses due to loan defaults.
This project aims to analyze historical loan data to identify key factors
that contribute to loan default risk and provide actionable insights
to support better lending decisions.
## 2.Business Context
This analysis aims to identify key factors associated with loan default risk using historical loan data.
The objective is to understand borrower and loan characteristics that contribute most significantly to default behavior, providing insights to support credit risk assessment and monitoring.
## 3.Key Risk Drivers Identified
Based on exploratory analysis, four primary risk drivers were identified:
### • Repayment Burden
Loans with higher loan-to-income ratios exhibit substantially higher default rates, indicating that repayment burden is a critical determinant of credit risk.
### • Loan Purpose
Small business loans show the highest default rates among all purposes, suggesting higher income volatility and business uncertainty compared to personal consumption loans.
### • Borrower Income
Default rates decrease consistently as borrower income increases, highlighting income stability as a protective factor, although income alone does not fully mitigate risk.
### • Loan Maturity
Default risk is heavily concentrated in the early stages of loan life and declines sharply after the first two years, indicating that default events are front-loaded.
## 4.Supporting Evidence
### 
Default rates more than double for borrowers whose loan amount exceeds approximately 30% of annual income.
###
Small business loans exhibit default rates exceeding 25%, significantly higher than consumer-focused loan purposes.
###
Borrowers in the lowest income band default at rates over 17%, compared to approximately 10% for the highest income group.
###
Loans older than two years show default rates below 5%, compared to over 20% in the first year.
